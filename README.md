### KPI Summary

Primary Benchmark Goals - Performance 

![Primary KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/b8cb26e7c5c8acf409476908ab3c6a8f5d009b0c/Primary%20Benchmark%20Goals.png)

Secondary Benchmark Goals - Efficiency

Below is a collective overview of the KPIs for all online ad campaigns from the data time frame.

- **Total Campaigns**: 3,453
- **Average Click-Through Rate**: 12.43%
- **Average Cost per Click**: $48.09
- **Average Cost per Conversion**: $159
- **Average Conversion Rate**: 50.51%
- **Average Cost per Mille**: $5,758.23
- **Average Viewability Rate**: 49.15%
- **Average Viewable Cost per Mille**: $23,781.14
- **Average Conversion Rate by Computer**: 50.99%
- **Average Conversion Rate by Smartphone**: 50.58%
- **Average Conversions Rate by Tablet**: 50.11%

Comparing StratusLink's KPIs ovber the six-week period to benchmark goals reveals a clear performance gap in cost-efficiency metrics, with the average vCPM exceeding it's target by as much as 4.5x. In contrast, performance rate metrics (e.g, CVR, CTR) largely meet benchmarks, with viewability as the only exception, falling notably short of its target. This suggests that improving viewability may be a critical lever in addressing underperforming metrics.

Average Converion Rate for each creative ad message:

- **Get Unlimited**: 50.44%
- **Fast Wifi Now**: 49.03%
- **Switch & Save**: 48.87%
- **Upgrade Today**: 48.68%

According to our analysis, the 'Get Unlimited' ad message was the only variant to meet the CVR goal, though the remaining messages performed comparably. A closer examination reveals a clear pattern: the two-top performing messages highlight a specific benefit of becoming a StratusLink customer, whereas the lower-performing variants rely on more direct, action-oriented language. This suggests that emphasizing tangible customer benefits is more effective at driving conversions than simply prompting users to act.

Although all but one message fell short of the individual CVR goal, the collective average CVR still meets the benchmark. This indicates that while messaging variation influences performance at the individual level, it may not be the primary driver of overall campaign success.

## Spatial Analysis

![Top Performing US Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/0d1f4f73fda748b85ddec3c17b32c8959fd6679e/Top%20regions%20ctr.jpg)

The Northeast is the top performing region with a CTR of 12.75% while the Midwest falls on the oppposite end of the spectrum at 12.11%. The difference in CTR for both regions isn't particularly significant, as they both fall comfortably above the benchmark goal of 10%. This seems to suggest that, when ads are effectively delivered, messaging resonates consistently across regions. 

![Most Cost-Effective Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/bc52afddfe103346dc74babcab9fe577c5e88ee2/Top%20regions%20cost-effectiveness.jpg)

The West and South emerge as the most cost-efficient regions in the U.S, with the West delivering the lowest cost per view and click, and the South achieving the lowest cost per thousand impressions. This suggests that the West is more efficient at driving cost-effective engagement at a granular level, while the South offers greater efficiency at scale.

![Least Cost-Effective Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/6dcb7706ba9567462036dcbe1efd235579634054/Bottom%20regions%20by%20cost-effecitveness.png)

In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest are the least cost-efficient regions. The Northeast is the most expensive in terms of both cost per view and cost per thousand impressions, while the Midwest incurs the highest cost per click. Notably, the Midwest also records the lowest CTR, making its high CPC particularly concerning.

![National Viewability](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/f2bc2dd91a4ea7a7d8d0e2d471c2ea67af2d8a0e/National%20Viewability.png)

Regional viewability remains highly consistent, with less than a half of a percent difference between the highest and lowest performing regions. This suggests that regional variation is likely not a major factor of viewability underperformance.



At the state level, Iowa (Midwest) records the highest viewability rate. Given that the Midwest overall underperforms on viewability, this suggests Iowa may be an outlier worth analyzing to identify factors that could improve regional performance. A similar pattern may be observed in the Northeast, where Massachusetts and Delaware outperform their region's relatively low viewability, offering additional opportunities for insight and optimization. 



Connecticut (Northeast), by contrast, records the lowest viewability by a significant margin, suggesting that targeted improvements in this state could meaningfully lift overall viewability in the region. Similarly, Texas and Louisiana (South) rank among the bottom five states for viewability. If we address the underperformance of these two states, we may further strengthen an already relatively strong region.



Four of the Five states with the highest vCPM are located in the West, which may help explain the regions strong cost-efficiency at a granular level but diminishing efficiency as scale increases. In contrast, the five states with the lowest vCPM are distributed across regions, with the South being notably absent. This is somewhat unexpected given that the South has the lowest overall CPM, suggesting a potentially significant disconnect between ad impressions and actual viewability in the region.



The top five states by CTR are distributed across regions, each exceeding the national average by more than one percentage point. This suggests that high-performing states may offer localized insights that can be leveraged to improve CTR within their respective regions.



In contrast, three of the bottom five states for CTR are located in the South. While the region does not rank lowest overall, improving performance in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana could elevate the South into a top-performing region.



Across other key metrics, both the Midwest and West are strongly represented among top-performing states. While the West's presence aligns with its cost-efficiency in driving views and clicks, the Midwest's representation is more unexpected given its relatively high CPC. Perhaps examining South Dakota's relatively high CPC in contrast with Wisconsins relatively low CPC can provide insights on how to improve cost-efficiency across the region.



Conversely, the lowest-performing states are distributed across all regions, with minimal variation between them. This pattern suggests that factors beyond regional differences may be contributing to lower cost-efficiency. 



In terms of urbanicity, CTR is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas. This may help explain regional differences, as the Northeast's higher CTR aligns with its dense concentration of urban and suburban population, while the Midwest's lower CTR reflects its more rural composition. 



Urban areas also demonstrate the highest viewability rates, which is likely another factor in it's stronger average CTR. In contrast, rural areas exhibit the highest conversion rates, indicating untapped potential that may be constrained by lower visibility.



Additionally, rural areas incure the highest costs per view, further emphasizing their inefficiency. Limited visibility and higher costs might be hurting the overall conversion rates of those areas. Addressing these metrics could result in substaintial gains in conversions.
