### KPI Summary

Primary Benchmark Goals - Performance 

![Primary KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/b8cb26e7c5c8acf409476908ab3c6a8f5d009b0c/Primary%20Benchmark%20Goals.png)

Secondary Benchmark Goals - Efficiency

![Secondary KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/a7bb563d61548bc09e374c9b58b0f1f5b44a7093/Secondary%20Benchmark%20Goals.png)

Below is a collective overview of the KPIs for all online ad campaigns from the data time frame.

- **Total Campaigns**: 3,453
- **Average Click-Through Rate**: 12.43%
- **Average Cost per Click**: $48.09
- **Average Cost per Conversion**: $159
- **Average Conversion Rate**: 50.51%
- **Average Cost per Mille**: $5,758.23
- **Average Viewability Rate**: 49.15%
- **Average Viewable Cost per Mille**: $23,781.14
- **Average Conversion Rate by Computer**: 50.99%
- **Average Conversion Rate by Smartphone**: 50.58%
- **Average Conversions Rate by Tablet**: 50.11%

Comparing StratusLink's KPIs ovber the six-week period to benchmark goals reveals a clear performance gap in cost-efficiency metrics, with the average vCPM exceeding it's target by as much as 4.5x. In contrast, performance rate metrics (e.g, CVR, CTR) largely meet benchmarks, with viewability as the only exception, falling notably short of its target. This suggests that improving viewability may be a critical lever in addressing underperforming metrics.

Average Converion Rate for each creative ad message:

- **Get Unlimited**: 50.44%
- **Fast Wifi Now**: 49.03%
- **Switch & Save**: 48.87%
- **Upgrade Today**: 48.68%
- **Start Your Plan**: 48.67%

According to our analysis, the 'Get Unlimited' ad message was the only variant to meet the CVR goal, though the remaining messages performed comparably. A closer examination reveals a clear pattern: the two-top performing messages highlight a specific benefit of becoming a StratusLink customer, whereas the lower-performing variants rely on more direct, action-oriented language. This suggests that emphasizing tangible customer benefits is more effective at driving conversions than simply prompting users to act.

Although all but one message fell short of the individual CVR goal, the collective average CVR still meets the benchmark. This indicates that while messaging variation influences performance at the individual level, it may not be the primary driver of overall campaign success.

## Spatial Analysis

![Top Performing US Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/0d1f4f73fda748b85ddec3c17b32c8959fd6679e/Top%20regions%20ctr.jpg)

The Northeast is the top performing region with a CTR of 12.75% while the Midwest falls on the oppposite end of the spectrum at 12.11%. The difference in CTR for both regions isn't particularly significant, as they both fall comfortably above the benchmark goal of 10%. This seems to suggest that, when ads are effectively delivered, messaging resonates consistently across regions. 

![Most Cost-Effective Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/bc52afddfe103346dc74babcab9fe577c5e88ee2/Top%20regions%20cost-effectiveness.jpg)

The West and South emerge as the most cost-efficient regions in the U.S, with the West delivering the lowest cost per view and click, and the South achieving the lowest cost per thousand impressions. This suggests that the West is more efficient at driving cost-effective engagement at a granular level, while the South offers greater efficiency at scale.

![Least Cost-Effective Regions](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/6dcb7706ba9567462036dcbe1efd235579634054/Bottom%20regions%20by%20cost-effecitveness.png)

In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest are the least cost-efficient regions. The Northeast is the most expensive in terms of both cost per view and cost per thousand impressions, while the Midwest incurs the highest cost per click. Notably, the Midwest also records the lowest CTR, making its high CPC particularly concerning.

![National Viewability](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/f2bc2dd91a4ea7a7d8d0e2d471c2ea67af2d8a0e/National%20Viewability.png)

Regional viewability remains highly consistent, with less than a half of a percent difference between the highest and lowest performing regions. This suggests that regional variation is likely not a major factor of viewability underperformance.

![Viewability by State](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/2804eca2a4309e7f25a48fa296f60bceaff233d1/Viewability%20by%20state.png)

At the state level, Iowa (Midwest) records the highest viewability rate. Given that the Midwest overall underperforms on viewability, this suggests Iowa may be an outlier worth analyzing to identify factors that could improve regional performance. A similar pattern may be observed in the Northeast, where Massachusetts and Delaware outperform their region's relatively low viewability, offering additional opportunities for insight and optimization. 

Connecticut (Northeast), by contrast, records the lowest viewability by a significant margin, suggesting that targeted improvements in this state could meaningfully lift overall viewability in the region. Similarly, Texas and Louisiana (South) rank among the bottom five states for viewability. If we address the underperformance of these two states, we may further strengthen an already relatively strong region.

![vCPM by State](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/692e22b6e8c4e1e2da31642f02a0900950bc0c74/vCPM%20numbers.png)

Four of the Five states with the highest vCPM are located in the West, which may help explain the regions strong cost-efficiency at a granular level but diminishing efficiency as scale increases. In contrast, the five states with the lowest vCPM are distributed across regions, with the South being notably absent. This is somewhat unexpected given that the South has the lowest overall CPM, suggesting a potentially significant disconnect between ad impressions and actual viewability in the region.

![Top States by CTR](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/0784b9c26b8461a2e42037a286e93936f89b5031/Top%20States%20CTR.png)

The top five states by CTR are distributed across regions, each exceeding the national average by more than one percentage point. This suggests that high-performing states may offer localized insights that can be leveraged to improve CTR within their respective regions.

![Worst States by CTR](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/68971003bb0e2bf299d6c60e8947272636124041/bottom_states_CTR.png)

In contrast, three of the bottom five states for CTR are located in the South. While the region does not rank lowest overall, improving performance in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana could elevate the South into a top-performing region.

![Top US States by Other Metrics](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/4422fa37df1680de8e06a28d2d421c38c4050cbc/Top_States_Metrics.png)

Across other key metrics, both the Midwest and West are strongly represented among top-performing states. While the West's presence aligns with its cost-efficiency in driving views and clicks, the Midwest's representation is more unexpected given its relatively high CPC. Perhaps examining South Dakota's relatively high CPC in contrast with Wisconsins relatively low CPC can provide insights on how to improve cost-efficiency across the region.

![Bottom US States by Other Metrics](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/4422fa37df1680de8e06a28d2d421c38c4050cbc/Bottom_States_Metrics.png)

Conversely, the lowest-performing states are distributed across all regions, with minimal variation between them. This pattern suggests that factors beyond regional differences may be contributing to lower cost-efficiency. 

![CTR by Urbanicity](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3e1d0f83232d69cdfc4acab7651db961762bb37c/CTR_by_Urbanicity.png)

In terms of urbanicity, CTR is highest in urban areas and lowest in rural areas. This may help explain regional differences, as the Northeast's higher CTR aligns with its dense concentration of urban and suburban population, while the Midwest's lower CTR reflects its more rural composition. 

![Urbanicity Metrics](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3e1d0f83232d69cdfc4acab7651db961762bb37c/Urbanicity_Metrics.png)

Urban areas also demonstrate the highest viewability rates, which is likely another factor in it's stronger average CTR. In contrast, rural areas exhibit the highest conversion rates, indicating untapped potential that may be constrained by lower visibility.

![vCPM by Urbanicity](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3e1d0f83232d69cdfc4acab7651db961762bb37c/vCPM_by_Urbanicity.png)

Additionally, rural areas incure the highest costs per view, further emphasizing their inefficiency. Limited visibility and higher costs might be hurting the overall conversion rates of those areas. Addressing these metrics could result in substaintial gains in conversions.

## Audience Analysis

### Age

![Age Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/029001f7315be4146055f7cc3e555367f3af2f21/Age_Breakdown.png)

A breakdown of our audience by age group shows that individuals aged 55+ represent the largest share, while those aged 18-24 comprise the smallest. Both groups are notably seperated from the other age segments, indicating a significant disparity in audience distribution.

![KPIs by Age Group](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/029001f7315be4146055f7cc3e555367f3af2f21/Age_Metrics.png)

An analysis of KPIs by age group reveals the following trends:

- Ages 45-54 emerge as the strongest overall segment across performance metrics.
- Individuals aged 55 and older are the most cost-effective group, potentially reflecting greater autonomy and fewer financial constraints (car payments, mortgage, etc).
- Ages 35-44 demonstrate the weakest engagement levels relative to other segments.
- Ages 18-24 are the most expensive to convert, which may be influenced by structural factors such as limited-decision making authority or constrained living situations (college campus, parent's home, etc).

### Gender

![Gender Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/ae2673aecdf3fd8beca4adcf1fa082678cd451e6/Gender%20Breakdown.png)

A breakdown of the audience by gender shows a relatively even distribution overall, with non-binary individuals representing the largest segment. Given the relatively small non-binary population in the U.S, this likely signals a substantial portion of users whose gender could not be definitely identified, rather than a true overrepresentation of non-binary individuals in the audience.

![Gender KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/ae2673aecdf3fd8beca4adcf1fa082678cd451e6/Gender_KPIs.png)

Analyzing the KPIs by gender delivers the following trends:

- Female users drive the strongest engagement with the highest CTR and a relatively efficient CPC.
- Male users demonstrate steady performance with an above-benchmark CTR and relatively competitive costs overall.
- Non-binary users exhibit the lowest CTR and highest CPC, which may reflect challenges in audience identification and suggest an oppurtunity to adopt more inclusive, broadly resonant messaging.

### Education

![Education Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/2adb96326ee000a43296cd69be5ee493695bd98d/Education_Breakdown.png)

A breakdown of the audience by education level shows a diverse distribution of different education levels, with Postgraduate individuals making up the largest educational segment in the audience. 

![Education KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/2adb96326ee000a43296cd69be5ee493695bd98d/Education_KPIs.png)

An analysis of KPIs by education level reveals the following trends:

- College graduate drive the most cost-efficient acquisition by a notable margin.
- High school graduates demonstrate the highest engagement, with the strongest CTR.
- Post graduates generate the lowest CPC, indicating the most cost-efficient traffic.
- Exposure costs, while efficient at a granular level, become increasingly volatile at scale, suggesting potential inefficiencies in broader reach strategies.

### Occupation

![Occupation Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/814223ec9db40d49bd6c26870df4076a7f3a7fec/Occupation_Breakdown.png)

A review of audience distribution by occupation shows significant variability across segments. Notably, unemployed users represent a disproportionately large share of the audience, while students account for a relatively small portion. The student segment likely overlaps with the 18-24 age group, which as previously noted, may have limited influence over ISP decisions. In contrast, unemployed individuals may have greater time and incentive to evaluate available offers.

![Occupation KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/814223ec9db40d49bd6c26870df4076a7f3a7fec/Occupation_KPIs.png)

An analysis of KPIs by occupation reveals several trends:

- Retired individuals are the most cost-efficient to convert, reinforcing earlier findings that older audiences (55+) are both the largest and most efficient segment.
- Students drive the highest engagement (CTR), but they are also the most expensive to convert and have the highest CPC, likely reflecting limited decision-making authority.
- Homemakers & Self-Employed individuals deliver the most balanced performance. Homemakers may represent an underleveraged segment with meaningful household influence, while self-employed users may respond well to messaging that emphasize flexible internet solutions for both personal and business use.

### Income

![Income Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/1e55ea2d01acbe7603b24ccbe8e035a528b382db/Income_Breakdown.png)

A breakdown of the audience by income shows that high-income users represent the largest segment, with low and middle-income groups also comprising meaningful, albeit smaller, portions of the audience.

![Income KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/1e55ea2d01acbe7603b24ccbe8e035a528b382db/Income_KPIs.png)

An analysis of KPIs by income reveals the following trends:

- High income users are the most cost-efficient segment, with a strong CTR, suggesting that messaging resonates well and pricing is unlikely to be a barrier.
- Middle-income users show steady, balanced performance across CTR and cost metrics, indicating consistent responsiveness without significant cost concerns.
- Low-income users generate the highest CTR but are the least cost-efficient overall. This pattern may reflect strong interest, but pricing that might be too prohibitive for them to convert. These users may be more inclined to explore options, hence the high CTR.

### Marital Status

![Marital Status Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/c6827ff2716e8034091abbc159f88d28caa22cf8/Marital_Status_Breakdown.png)

A breakdown of the audience by marital status shows a relatively even distribution, although divorced individuals represent a significantly larger segment than the others.

![Marital Status KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/c6827ff2716e8034091abbc159f88d28caa22cf8/Marital_Status_KPIs.png)

An analysis of KPIs by marital status uncovers these key trends:

- Single users represent the most efficient segment for acquisition despite having the lowest CTR. This might suggest a disconnect between the percieved value of StratusLink based on messaging, and the actual value once fully examined.
- Divorced users demonstrate solid engagement but comparatively lower cost-efficiency.
- Widowed users generate the most cost-efficient traffic and engagement, with the lowest CPC and CPM across segments.
- The metrics across marital segments are rather variable, with married users consistently performing near the middle of the pack across metrics, potentially reflecting more stable and predictable behavior.

### Family Size

![Family Size Breakdown](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/2922c6fb0e518c0382173cf7788903677c975b83/Family%20Size%20Breakdown.png)

An audience breakdown of the audience by household composition shows a relatively even distribution, with single-person households representing the largest segment. This aligns with earlier findings, where single, divorced, and widowed individuals collectively make up almost three-quarters of the audience.

![Family Size KPIs](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/2922c6fb0e518c0382173cf7788903677c975b83/Family%20Size%20KPIs.png)

An analysis of KPIs by household size uncovers several key trends:

- Two-person households emerge as the strongest overall segment, delivering the lowest cost per conversion and cost per click. This may reflect dual-income dynamics, which would align with earlier findings that higher-income users are most cost-efficient.
- Households with children have the highest engagement, potentially driven by a greater need for reliable and cost-effective internet services.
- Single-person households underperform relative to other segments, representing a potential area of concern given their share of the overall audience.

### Conclusion

After evaluating every insight from the audience data, three key personas emerge as the most promising targets for maximizing performance and cost-efficiency.

![Persona 1](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/00e9bbada0a8617a8f5794f48afbe3ab956ba35e/Persona%201.png)

![Persona 2](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/00e9bbada0a8617a8f5794f48afbe3ab956ba35e/Persona%202.png)

![Persona 3](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/00e9bbada0a8617a8f5794f48afbe3ab956ba35e/Persona%203.png)

## Creative Analysis

### Creative Sizing

An analysis of seven creative sizes shows only a slight performance variation, as each variant exceeds the CTR benchmark. That said, the following are the top three creative sizes based on CTR.

- **970x250**: 12.92% CTR
- **300x50**: 12.68% CTR
- **720x90**: 12.67% CTR

The 970×250 format is most commonly served on desktop devices, while the 300×50 format is primarily associated with mobile placements. In contrast, the 728×90 format is more evenly distributed across desktop, mobile, and tablet environments, demonstrating a level of versatility not seen in the other sizes.

![Creative Sizing Cost-Effectiveness](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/c25db0426d6b1355c92b526fb0868d4f204964cc/Creative_Sizing_Cost_Effectiveness.png)

An analysis of cost-efficiency across the top five creative sizes highlights 300x250 and 728x90 as the strongest performers. The 300x250 is primarily mobile driven, while the 728x90 offers versatility across devices. Prioritizing these formats may help address broader cost-efficiency challenges. 

![Creative Sizing Viewabiility](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/c25db0426d6b1355c92b526fb0868d4f204964cc/Creative_Sizing_Viewability.png)

A comparison of viewability and vCPM reveals a significant gap between performance and benchmarks. Consistent with other findings, the 300×250 and 728×90 formats remain the most cost-effective, reinforcing their importance in future optimization efforts. However, persistently low viewability across all sizes indicates a broader issue that warrants focused improvement.

### Devices

Devices performance by conversion rate:

- **Smartphone**: 50.25%
- **Computer**: 50.34%
- **Tablet**: 51.20%

Tablets demonstrate the highest CVR across devices, though differences are marginal and all devices exceed the 50% benchmark.

![Device Cost-Effectiveness](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/17b40e1bbb030f61003134502479294647fb34e3/Device_Cost_Effectiveness.png)

In terms of cost-efficiency, computers and smartphones perform comparably, while tablets lag behind. This suggests prioritizing desketop and mobile channels for efficiency, while limiting tablet investment to versatile, cross-device creative formats rather than tablet-specific placements.

### Creative Messaging

![Creative Messaging CTR](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3115f0dc1dcd530a3de8b3a0c5fcbacf84bb38d6/Creative_Messaging_CTR.png)

An analysis of creative messaging shows that “Start Your Plan” drives the highest CTR, while “Fast Wifi Now” generates the lowest. Notably, action-oriented messaging appears to generate stronger engagement. Based off the information from the introduction, which outlined the superior conversion rates of benefit-driven messaaging, a performance trade-off between clicks and conversions appears to be present.

![Creative Messaging Cost Effectiveness](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3115f0dc1dcd530a3de8b3a0c5fcbacf84bb38d6/Creative_Messaging_Cost_Effectiveness.png)

Cost-efficiency metrics are relatively consistent across messages; however, “Start Your Plan,” despite its high CTR, is the least cost-efficient with the highest CPM and CPC. Overall, benefit-driven messaging demonstrates slightly stronger efficiency, suggesting that prioritizing these variants may improve conversion outcomes while moderating costs, albeit with some tradeoff in click volume. 

### Ad Positioning

![Ad Position CTR](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3a3afc1125f7b107e1e3c8d8fc45fe585ad14514/Ad_Position_Performance.png)

An analysis of ad positioning shows that below-the-fold placements generate the highest CTR, while sidebar placements perform the weakest. Overall, ads positioned closer to the center of the page tend to outperform those at the periphery. Below-the-fold placements appear to strike a balance between visibility and user experience, offering strong engagement without being overly intrusive.

![Ad Position Cost-Effectiveness](https://github.com/ArmandoDominguez97/Online-Ad-Campaign-Analysis/blob/3a3afc1125f7b107e1e3c8d8fc45fe585ad14514/Ad_Position_Cost_Effectiveness.png)

From a cost-efficiency perspective, below-the-fold and footer placements deliver the strongest value, while sidebar ads are the least cost-effective. Combined with their weaker engagement performance, this suggests that sidebar placements should be deprioritized in favor of more centrally positioned formats to optimize overall ROI
